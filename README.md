# predict_titanic_survival_rate
In this project, I use an uncoventional approach to solve the kaggle problem definition of the popular titanic dataset. I wrangled and cleansed the data, explored and analyzed to identify patterns and also visualized when needed. I trained five machine learning models to predict outcomes and solve the problem. The performance level of each model is evaluated. The datasets contain information about passengers that boarded the ship -- their ages, sexes, sibling and parents counts, embarkment points, fare and whether or not they survived. <br>
* This project is done completely using Jupyter Notebook
* The required packages/libraries to perform specific functions are imported as needed.
